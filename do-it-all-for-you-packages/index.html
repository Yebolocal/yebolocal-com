 <p> We will meet with you in person or interact via email or phone to find out what you want to achieve with your web presence and design your web presence based on your description and the information you provide. </p>
 <p> A designer will spend up to 3 hours with you to determine what you want, make recommendations and with your approval design and develop the website, set up all the settings and to optimise the website with basic search engine optimisation. </p>
 <p> Yebolocal websites are mostly, with a few exceptions, made up out of static web pages. Static web pages load faster, have much fewer errors and are much more secure.</p>
